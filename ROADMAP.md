## Usability
 * Creating the ./Bestiary folder if it does not exist
 * Be able to modify the tree
 * save/cleanup functionality

## Code structure
 * Create a makefile or equivalent
 * Add commentary
 * Move string manipulation function to a specific file
 * Separate the command line interface from the bestiary elements logic

## Interface
 * Add some css to the html files

## Bugs
 * For some reason the copy adds a bunch of gibberish to the end of the html file
